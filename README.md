# RSA-Based-File-Encryption-and-Digital-Signature-System
# I. Introduction 
In today’s world, our important files (photos, documents, IDs, messages) can be easily stolen or changed. This project, “RSA-Based File Encryption and Digital Signature System”, is a simple Python program that uses RSA the same strong encryption used by banks and WhatsApp to keep files safe in two ways:
•	Encryption: Locks any file so only the person with the private key can open it.
•	Digital Signature: Adds a secure seal to prove the file is really from you and hasn’t been altered.
The goal I want to Build an easy tool that gives real security to everyone and I want to learn real RSA hands-on, use a trusted professional library, and make powerful protection simple enough for non-tech people (friends, family, teachers) to use safely.
